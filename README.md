## Concurrency
Typically, applications or programs on a computer or phone perform more than one operation, this is called concurrency, we will first discuss the basics of concurrency, ie threads and tasks, and in the next lesson we will go to asynchrony.

The most common examples of concurrency:
1. In mobile applications, WPF, websites, tasks must be run concurrently with the code responsible for the user interface to maintain responsive.
2. The operating system performs some tasks concurrently, eg if you have a computer turned on you usually have more than one program enabled, if the operating system didn’t perform these tasks concurrently, then we could have only one program switched on at a time.
3. In portals or online stores, when more than one user uses them in an instant, concurrency allows processing more than one client’s request at once.
